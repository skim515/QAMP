    "text": "About QAMP Lab\n\nQAMP에서는 인간행동이나 심리적 속성에 대한 수량화 및 모델링, 연구 설계, 자료분석에서 새로운 방법을 개발하거나, 기존의 분석 방법을 확장하거나 평가하는 연구를 수행합니다. ’심리학’이라고 생각하기 보다는 ’응용통계’라고 생각하는게 더 이해가 빠를것 입니다. 다만 행동과학에서 얻는 자료의 독특한 특성, 그리고 심리학이라는 맥락 내에서의 방법론을 연구하기 때문에 통계학과에서의 방식과는 차이가 있습니다.\n\n\nQAMP에서 수행하는 연구의 목표는 크게 다음의 세 가지 정도로 나눌 수 있습니다.\n(1) 심리학 연구에 적용되는 연구 설계나 분석에서 어떠한 문제점이 나타날 수 있으며 어떻게 해결할 수 있는지 소개하고 더 나은 방향을 제시. 기존의 분석 방법들이 심리학 데이터에서 흔히 나타나는 여러 조건들에서 평가\n(2) 척도의 타당도와 신뢰도를 평가하고, 측정학적으로 더 나은 척도 연구 및 개발\n(3) 새로운 분석 방법을 심리학 분야에 적용하여 기존의 방법론으로는 알 수 없었던 함의점 도출\n\n\n\nFAQ\n\n1 . 대학원 진학 전에 무엇을 준비해야 하나요?\n\n심리측정통계를 전공하기 위해 반드시 갖추어야 할 점은 심리통계나 연구방법론에 대한 흥미와 호기심입니다. 통계나 방법론 수업을 들으면서 통계분석이 유용하다고 느꼈고 더 알고싶다는 생각이 들었다면 이미 갖춘것이지요. 또한, 분석 툴(tool) 다루는 것을 두려워 하지 않는 태도가 필요합니다(분석 툴에는 SPSS, R 등 프로그램 활용이 포함 됨). 우리 학생들이 통계수업을 싫어하는 이유중 하나가 프로그램 사용에 대하여 장벽을 느끼기 때문입니다. 몇 번 시켜보면 다들 잘 따라 하던데, 많은 학생들이 접근하는 것 자체를 지나치게 두려워 하는 것 같습니다. 그리고 대학원 공부에서 가장 많이 요구되는 역량은 논리적 사고력 입니다. 또한 연구를 하고 논문을 쓰는 것이 대학원생의 일이기 때문에 글을 잘쓰는데 관심이 있다면 아주 좋습니다.\n\n\n\n2 . 어떤 과목을 수강하는 것이 진학에 유리할까요?\n\n‘심리통계나 연구방법론 외에 심리측정통계 대학원 진학을 위해서 신경써야 하는 심리학 전공 과목은 어떤 것이 있는지?’ 학생들의 문의가 많습니다. 방법론전공은 상당히 실용적인 목적에서 생긴 전공힙니다. 방법론은 홀로 따로 존재하는 것이 아니라 심리학의 세부전공(임상이나 상담, 발달 등)의 맥락 속에서 나온 것이므로 내용측면 전공 하나에 관심이 있는 것이 좋습니다. 제 학생들에게도 주전공 이외에 관심 내용 분야 하나를 정하여 부전공 처럼 생각하고 공부하라고 권합니다.\n\n\n\n3. 대학원을 졸업해서 주로 선택하는 직업들?\n\n심리측정통계나 계량심리학 석사졸업 후 많은 경우에 조사 분야나 데이터수집 및 관리 분야, 혹은 정부출연 연구소로 진출합니다. 제가 석사공부를 시작할 때 까지만 해도 한국계 기업은 일자리가 거의 없었고 외국계 기업에만 일자리가 있었는데, 현재는 SK, 삼성, LG 등 국내 대기업에서도 다양한 분야에서의 데이터분석 전문가를 채용하고 있고, 기업에서 인사/평가 관련하여 자료분석을 담당하는 측정학자 인력 수요도 꾸준히 늘고있습니다. 정부출연연구소의 경우, 패널조사 수집과 관리에 있어서 측정학자를 필요로하는 직무가 있습니다. 박사졸업 후에는 연구실적을 쌓아서 교수직에 도전할 수 있습니다. 출연연에서 책임급 연구원도 박사학위를 요구합니다.\n\n\n\n5 . 수학을 많이 잘해야 하는지?\n\n예 아니로 둘 중 하나로만 대답해야 한다면 아니오입니다. 수식이 나왔을 때 미리 앞서서 겁을 먹지 않으면 됩니다. 방법론을 연구하기 위해서 수학 자체를 사용한다고 보기는 어렵습니다. 갈래로 따지자면 응용통계의 한 분야이지요. 제가 생각하기에 심리측정통계를 전공하기 위한 핵심역량은 논리적/체계적 사고 입니다. 논리적 사고능력이 수리적인 능력과 관련이 있겠지만 수학과에서 하는 연구와는 많이 다릅니다. 수학과에서 하는 증명을 아무리 많이 할 줄 알아도 심리학 맥락에서의 방법론 연구를 바로 할 수는 없습니다.\n\n\n\n6 . 영어는 어느 정도 잘해야 되나요?\n\n읽고 쓸 수 있는 정도의 기본적인 영어 능력은 중요합니다. 학계에서 나오는 질 좋은 논문 대부분은 영어로 쓰여있기 때문에 적어도 영어로된 글을 읽고 이해를 할 수 있어야 합니다. 하지만!!! 영어보다 훨씬 더 중요한 것은 모국어를 잘하는 것입니다. 한국어로 논문을 잘 쓸 수 있으면 영어논문 쓰기는 한글로 쓴 것을 번역 하면 되기 때문에 별 문제가 안됩니다.\n\n\n\n7 . 컨택은 어떻게 하는건가요?\n\n혹시 지원을 하고자 한다면 지원하기 전에 지원하겠다고 미리 이야기 하는것이 좋고, 가능하다면 지원하기 전에 면담을 한번 하는것이 좋겠습니다. 면담 약속은 교수님께 이메일을 보내 시간을 잡는것을 추천합니다."
