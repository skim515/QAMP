    "text": "About QAMP Lab\n\nQAMP에서는 인간행동이나 심리적 속성에 대한 수량화 및 모델링, 기존의 분석 방법을 확장하거나 방향을 제시하는 연구, 양적자료 분석에 있어서 새로운 방법을 제안하거나 평가하는 연구를 수행합니다. 행동과학이라는 독특한 맥락 내에서 생긴 방법론에 대하여 탐구하는데 초점이 맞추어져 있습니다. ’심리학’이라고 생각하기 보다는 ’응용 통계’라고 생각하는 것이 이해가 더 빠를 수 있습니다.\n\n\nQAMP에서 수행하는 연구의 목표는 크게 다음의 세 가지 정도로 나눌 수 있습니다.\n(1) 심리학 연구에 적용되는 연구 설계나 분석에서 어떠한 문제점이 나타날 수 있으며 어떻게 해결할 수 있는지 소개하고 더 나은 방향을 제시. 기존의 분석 방법들을 실제 분석상황에서 나타나는 다양한 조건에서 평가\n(2) 척도의 타당도와 신뢰도를 평가하고, 측정학적으로 더 나은 척도 연구 및 개발\n(3) 새로운 양적분석 방법을 행동과학 분야에 적용하여 기존의 방법론으로는 알 수 없었던 함의점 도출\n\n\n\n\n대학원 진학에 관심이 있는 분은 지원 전에 면담을 하는 것이 좋겠습니다. 면담은 교수님께 이메일을 보내 시간 약속을 정하시기를 권장합니다.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ\n\n1 . 대학원 진학 전에 무엇을 준비하면 좋을까요?\n\n심리측정통계를 전공하기 위해 갖추어야 할 점을 중요도 순으로 나열하면 (1) 전공에 대한 흥미, (2) 논리적 사고, (3) 언어•의사소통 능력, (4) 기초 컴퓨터 언어입니다.\n심리통계나 양적연구방법론에 대한 흥미와 호기심은 전공 분야를 깊이 있게 파고들기 위해 필수적입니다. 심리통계나 방법론을 수강하면서 통계분석이 유용하다고 느꼈고 더 알고싶다는 생각이 들었다면 절반은 준비가 된 셈 입니다. 그리고, 대학원 공부에서 가장 많이 요구되는 역량은 논리적 사고력 입니다. 대학원에서 연구를 수행하는데 핵심역량입니다. 독서량이 많으면 유리하고 글을 잘쓰는데 관심이 있다면 아주 좋습니다. 내가 한 일을 다른 사람에게 말로 잘 전달하는 능력도 의사소통 능력에 들어갑니다. 컴퓨터 언어 관련해서는 분석 툴(tool) 다루는 것을 두려워 하지 않는 태도가 필요합니다(분석 툴에는 SPSS, R 등 프로그램 활용이 포함 됨). 많은 학생들이 통계가 힘들다고 이야기 하는데, 제가 보기에는 한 번도 안 해본 프로그램을 사용하는 것에 대하여 지나치게 큰 장벽을 상상하고 겁을 내는 것 같습니다.\n대학원 진학 후에는 지식습득 외 측면이 학생의 성취에 지대한 영향을 줍니다. 저는 제 학생이 (A) 체력 단련 습관, (B) 성장 마인드셋, (C) 불확실한 상황에서 불안을 다스리는 건강한 방법을 갖고 있으면 좋겠습니다.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. 심리측정통계 대학원 졸업 후 어떤 진로가 있나요?\n\n심리측정통계나 계량심리학 석사졸업 후 많은 경우에 조사 분야나 데이터수집 및 관리 분야, 혹은 정부출연 연구소로 진출합니다. 제가 석사공부를 시작할 때 까지만 해도 외국계 기업에만 일자리가 있었는데, 현재는 국내 기업에서도 다양한 분야에서의 데이터분석 전문가를 채용하고 있고, 기업에서 인사/평가 관련하여 자료분석을 담당하는 측정학자 인력 수요도 꾸준히 늘고있습니다. 정부출연연구소의 경우, 패널조사 수집과 관리에 있어서 심리측정학자를 필요로하는 직무가 있습니다. 박사졸업 후에는 연구실적을 쌓아서 학계에서 활동할 수 있습니다."
